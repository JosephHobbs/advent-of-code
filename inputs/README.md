# Input Files

Puzzle input files go here. Naming convention should be as follows...

- `yyyy-dd-example.txt` (sample/test data for year yyyy, day dd zero padded)
- `yyyy-dd-input.txt` (actual data for year yyyy, day dd zero padded)

I have purposely not included input files in adherence to the [Advent of Code author's wishes](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about#:~:text=Can%20I%20copy,it%20something%20similar.).
